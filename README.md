# storyboard-less
Creating an Xcode project without a storyboard

I never liked to use Xcode Interface Builder. It is a great tool for learning and I am sure a lot of developers find it an excellent tool to build their APPS. 

This is just my personal choice. I like to (think) I control, as much as possible, what my code is doing (the reality is has many points of view).

This guide has been updated to Xcode Version 14.2.
